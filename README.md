# README Generator

## Description

I was motivated to update the code for this Project Task Board as part of my bootcamp week5 challenge. This wesite was built to allow a user to track projects. I was able to make a responsive website that allows the user to track projects.

Once the user has run "node index" in the terminal and input responses to the prompted questions, there will be a README.md file created in that folder.
